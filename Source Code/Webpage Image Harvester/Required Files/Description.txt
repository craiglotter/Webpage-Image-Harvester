Webpage Image Harvester

Webpage Image Harvester is used to parse HTML files, locating all valid '<IMG src=' tags for download purposes. Based on the accept file types entered by the user, the application can then be used to download the selected files. This application is great for quickly ripping images from existing pages. Multiple page URLs can be specified using ';' as the delimiting character.
